## Introduction 
MIRROR, lululemon's first cutting-edge at-home fitness platform, officially launched in November 2020. The product is essentially a smart mirror with a built-in screen, speakers, and a webcam integrated into the design, which is linked to the application to stream fitness classes. The app allows users to choose from a variety of interactive workouts led by lululemon ambassadors and well-known fitness instructors.

This launch serves as the foundation for the marketing strategy you'll develop, with the primary goal of emphasizing the product's benefits. We want you to leverage this one-of-a-kind product release to create a plan that serves one more purpose, to raise awareness of some of the most important values we support as a company: diversity and inclusion. 

## Task 1: Developing an integrated marketing plan
Create an integrated marketing plan and creative brief for lululemon's newest at-home fitness platform, MIRROR, designed to raise awareness of the product and core values relevant to lululemon's position within communities.</br>
The strategy should aim to raise brand awareness and stimulate sales while also bringing the brand's message about the importance of diversity and inclusion to a broader audience. By applying a holistic, comprehensive narrative, integrated marketing plans ensure that target groups receive a consistent message across all channels. A brief focusing on strategy for a plan that is both innovative and powerful enough to advertise the company's offering and offer captivating and relevant storytelling. The questions that your creative brief should answer include:
1. What is the plan's main objective?</br>
2. Who is the target audience?</br> 
3. What is the plan's primary message? </br>
4. What channels will you use?</br>
5. What assets will you require? </br>
6. Who will be engaged in the project? </br>
7. What is the project timeline?</br>
8. How will you measure the results?</br>

## Task 2: Digital transformation of the retail guest experience
Develop a concept for a new digital product or customer experience that lululemon could implement within the technical athletic apparel space.
lululemon has recently formed a partnership with a well-known professional athlete to feature branded apparel and accessories related to that athlete and their athletic performance requirements. The collection of such clothing and accessories is extensive, with many different styles, fabrics, looks, and options, and most of it cannot be stocked in stores. Thus, guests will only see and be able to try on a limited selection of the athlete’s full assortment of products in stores.

## Task 3: Hyperlocal marketing with ambassadors
Review the profiles of current lululemon global ambassadors and create hypothetical profiles for local ambassadors to further lululemon's new “Power of Three x 2 Growth Strategy”.
The Power of Three x 2 Growth Strategy includes a plan to double men's revenue and digital revenue and to quadruple international revenue by 2026. In order to meet these goals, lululemon is dedicated to creating world-class experiences for its guests, building stronger connections across both physical and digital, cultivating the community, and driving innovation. 
To create the profiles, ask the following questions:
1. What does this person do for a living? </br>
2. What does this person promote on their social media?</br>
3. Is this person currently promoting brands similar to lululemon?</br>
4. What is this person's personality?</br>
5. How does this person align with the lululemon brand? </br>
6. How is this person involved in their specific city or community?</br>
7. What social media posts or promotions would help this person drive traffic to a specific store?</br>

## Task 4: Data Analysis
Calculate key marketing metrics based on data from a recent lululemon ambassador campaign and communicate your findings from the data to your manager.
A big part of any marketing campaign is data. Your team is constantly collecting data on products, trends, competitors, and consumers, and this information is critical to any successful marketing operation. As a junior-level team member, you are responsible for helping to analyze data and draw conclusions based on your findings. 
Some of the data most important to marketers are:</br>
Customer conversion rates, customer acquisition costs, return on investment, cost per lead, customer lifetime value, click-through rate, bounce rate, session time, unsubscribe rate, and more.
